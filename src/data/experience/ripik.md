### Summary
Engineered and optimized web applications and dashboards for 12+ AI-powered industrial applications, collaborating with global clients in the steel and cement sectors.

### Key Responsibilities & Achievements
- Engineered responsive dashboards using React.js, Tailwind, and MUI.
- Spearheaded the creation of a standardized, configuration-driven frontend UI framework that cut development time by 90% (from 2 weeks to 2 days). This framework has now been adopted across 8+ applications.
- Architectured and optimized real-time data and media streaming systems using WebSockets and Socket.IO, reducing update frequency from 15 seconds to <300 milliseconds.
- Pioneered on-edge real-time model inference by integrating YOLOv8n into the browser using ONNX, WebGL and WebGPU. This enabled <40ms inference latency and eliminated server-side compute.
- Created the front end of a complex production planning dashboard with global state management using Redux and React for an international steel client.
- Implemented CI/CD workflows and automation using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Slack webhooks across 14 remote server locations, saving 10+ developer hours weekly.
- Enabled real-time video streaming by converting RTSP camera feeds to WebSocket streams using Go2RTC, reducing latency by 91%.
- Contributed to the development of the v2 deno platform UI. The demos were praised by leadership and used in 20+ client meetings, contributing to multiple signed deals.
- Designed and built REST APIs for core business applications and reduced API response time by 20% using DB optimizations.
